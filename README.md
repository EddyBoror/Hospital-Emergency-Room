# Project Overview

The next project was something new and thrilling for me. I was excited to dive into a medical dataset and explore the unknown areas to learn more about how the variables and values in this dataset varied from those in my earlier works. In addition, this project allowed me to become more familiar with Power BI, a tool I hadn't used aside from Tableau, for dashboard building and visualization. My goal was to create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for a hospital emergency room that would allow users to see patient satisfaction ratings and average age in a simulated dataset.

# Issues

- The dataset's quality was effective, and no problems were found when analyzing it.

- I created more variables to improve the depth of the analysis.

- I created new metrics to enable comparisons in addition to more perceptive calculations.


# Data Sources
I obtained the proxy dataset from Data.world, which comprises various datasets contributed by the community. It's important to note that the information within the dataset is not real, as it's fabricated to avoid HIPAA violations and is solely used for project development purposes.
